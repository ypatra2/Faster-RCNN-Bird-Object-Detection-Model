# Faster RCNN Bird Object Detection Model
- Implemented Faster-RCNN using PyTorch and Torchvision to generate object detections from bird images dataset <br>
- Developed a Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm that filtered bird object detections using an IoU threshold to obtain a single detection with the highest confidence score <br> 
- Achieved the lowest mean squared error using Faster-RCNN MobileNetv3 that was able to detect birds in camouflaged images too
